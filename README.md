HDX Country List
================

Assembling a working country list is always a challenge when developing world-wide proejcts at the United Nations. Several partners assemble their country lists based on their focuses, legacy, or other overrall criteria. But when considering the likelihood of responding to a humanitarian crisis, the country list can grow or shrink based on very different variables.

This repository is an attempt of creating a robust methodology for assembling such country list. It aims at finding the most suitable method for creating such list. Its final output is both the method and the list.
